        I got some peanuts and passed them through the cage to a gigantic gray {noun3}

        I went to get a {adjective3} scoop of ice cream. It filled my stomach. 
        Afterwards I had to {verb2} {adverb2} to catch our bus. When I got home I {verb3} my

    Today, my fabulous camp group went to a {adjective1} amusement park. It was a

    kind counselor shouted loudly, "Everybody off the {noun2}." We all pushed out in a terrible
    hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out
    what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller coaster I really liked so, I {adverb1} ran
    over to get in the long line that had about 10 people in it. When I finally
    got on the roller coaster I was {verb1}. In fact I was so nervous my two knees
    were knocking together. This was the {adjective2} ride I had ever been on! In about two
    minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom,
    I was a little  {verb2} but I was proud of myself. The rest of the day went {adverb2}. 
    It was a {adjective3} day at the fun park.
